# Wine Stable Scripts
These are my install scripts for the stable version of Wine 

To make the file executable do the following. 
> chmod +x ./W7U20-Stable.sh and to run 

Then
> ./W7U20-Stable.sh


Included in the releases package are the following Linux variations


Debian (This will work on any Ubuntu variation)
Fedora 35
Fedora 36


From there Wine will install without any issues.

### Naming Convention

Some of you may have noticed that I have given new names to all the packages and I believe that they are pretty self explanatory. But I will go over the new naming convention now!

All files beginning with ```W7``` are to be considered Wine 7.0 or in the 7.0 family.
Any file that has a letter as the third character denotes the operating system EG ```W7U``` stands for Wine 7 Ubuntu.
Any file with a numbering after the 2nd letter means the operating system version. EG ```W7U18``` Means, Wine 7 for Ubuntu 18.
And finally. The word after the dash means the version of wine that is available for the operating system.


### A thanks

Thank you!
